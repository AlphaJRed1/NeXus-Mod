description: As punishment for your INCREDIBLY lackluster performance at operating a high value resource sector in Serpulo, you have been sent to a planet almost beyond the reaches of this solar system, a cold and sinister planet called Thanaras. Mystery fills the atmosphere, dread lurking at every corner, but, as fate may have it, you are not alone in this supposedly desolate wasteland. Figure out the inner workings of this planet's tech and hope to survive the onslaught of waves that will come your way.
